Questions / notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sensitive/Personal data - Make Individual ID stored as some kind of anonymous token in HTTP headers, session state or like-wise. We should avoid spilling over individually identifiable data in HTTP server logs etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
List filters and pagination should be universal for all of GovStack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Should we have CRUD for ""Individual""? Delete and update operations are dangerous / meaningless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
TODO,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Query parameters should declare types,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Specify the restricted fields that can be created/modified in schemas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
