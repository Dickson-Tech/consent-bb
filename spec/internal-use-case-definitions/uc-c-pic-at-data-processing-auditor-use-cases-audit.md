This results in a new entry in a registry that will record the Individual, his/her decision and the specific Consent Agreement as well as other necessary meta-data to subsequently manage the consent (e.g. dates, Consent Agreement version, â€¦).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Therefore the Data Policy Auditor has all the necessary, but limited, access rights to access the information. This can be done either with a specific component of the Application that allows these access to a person outside the organisation/department owning the application or by an authorised employee of the organisation operating under the instruction of the Data Policy Auditor (whose legitimity is specified in the Audit Framework).</p> |
