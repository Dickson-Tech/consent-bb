# 8 Service APIs

This section describes external APIs that must be implemented by the building block. Additional APIs may be implemented by the building block (all APIs must adhere to the standards and protocols defined), but the listed APIs define a minimal set that must be provided by any implementation.

The current API specification can be found here:

* [OpenAPI spec in GitHub](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/bb-consent/) _(open a PR if you want to suggest a change)_
* [Latest version rendered API spec](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/GovStack/consent-management-bb) _(view only)_

{% hint style="warning" %}
The API version follows the general version of the Consent BB and is released with the Consent BB as a whole. However, the API is currently undergoing review, refinements and redesign. Please consult the [Consent BB Working Group](./) for more guidance on the current versioning semantics.
